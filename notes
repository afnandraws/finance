look at section 17 for how fetch might look but also link on notion

look at react.memo as well as lazy loading

Refresh on react router and lazy loading

instead of using if statements, use routes from react-router

restructure the database hooking up, connect to a firestore database instead to have data related to each user

get the usersID then use that to create a directory

item slice: {
id:
title:
type:
price:
genre:
postedOn
}
